# Command Line Read Me
![License Badge](C:\Users\Alexa\desktop\CommandLineReadMe\license-badge.svg)
        
## Description

**Motivation:** This application was created in order to auto-generate a professional readme for applications. 

**The Why:** This command line prompted application will allow multiple users to create uniform readme files, prompted by queries they will create well formatted and professional readme guides to be utilised on any project. 

**Problem Solved:** This will solve issues of having to confirm and finesse markdown, recall what contents are required for a simple applicationâ€™s readme, and solve the issues of variation between single person or organisation-wide readme files. 

**Lessons:** This particular program has allowed the creator to utilise node, inquirer npm, fs (node), badge-maker npm, and path (node). It has also allowed the creator to explore back end programming
